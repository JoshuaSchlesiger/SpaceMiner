    <p><strong>Legal Basis</strong></p>
    <p>Here is an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that national data protection regulations in your or our country of residence may also apply. If more specific legal bases are applicable in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.</p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Contractual performance and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6(1) lit. b) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the data subject or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures requested by the data subject.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1) lit. f) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the data controller or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which require the protection of personal data, prevail.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to the GDPR, national data protection regulations in Germany apply, including the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz – BDSG). The BDSG contains special provisions regarding the right to information, the right to deletion, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, and transmission, as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. It also regulates data processing for the purposes of employment relationships (§ 26 BDSG), especially with regard to the establishment, implementation, or termination of employment relationships and the consent of employees. State data protection laws of individual federal states may also apply.</p>
    <p><strong>Security Measures</strong></p>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs, the nature, scope, circumstances, and purposes of processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.</p>
    <p>These measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data, as well as access, input, transmission, availability, and separation. We have also established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data threats. Furthermore, we consider data protection in the development or selection of hardware, software, and procedures, in accordance with the principle of data protection by design and by default.</p>
    <p>TLS encryption (https): To protect the data transmitted via our online offering, we use TLS encryption. You can recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix https:// in the address line of your browser.</p>
    <p><strong>Data Deletion</strong></p>
    <p>We delete the data we process in accordance with legal requirements as soon as the consent for processing is revoked or other permissions are revoked (e.g., when the purpose of processing this data has ceased or they are no longer necessary for the purpose). If the data is not deleted because it is required for other and legally permissible purposes, its processing is limited to these purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for commercial or tax reasons or whose storage is necessary for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person.</p>
    <p>Our data protection notices may also contain additional information on the storage and deletion of data that applies primarily to the respective processing.</p>
    <p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong></p>
    <p>Cookies are small text files or other storage markers that store information on end devices and retrieve information from end devices. For example, to store login status in a user account, shopping cart contents in an e-shop, visited content, or used functions of an online offering. Cookies can also be used for different purposes, such as functionality, security, and convenience of online offerings, as well as for analyzing visitor flows.</p>
    <p><strong>Consent Notes:</strong> We use cookies in accordance with legal regulations. Therefore, we obtain prior consent from users, unless it is not required by law. Consent is not necessary, in particular, if storing and reading the information, including cookies, is absolutely necessary to provide users with a telemedia service expressly requested by them (i.e., our online offering). Revocable consent is communicated clearly to users and includes information on the specific use of cookies.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes on Data Protection Legal Bases:</strong> The legal basis on which we process users" personal data using cookies depends on whether we ask users for consent. If users consent, the legal basis for processing their data is the declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed using cookies is based on our legitimate interests (e.g., in the economically viable operation of our online offering and improving its usability) or, if necessary for the fulfillment of our contractual obligations, the use of cookies is required to fulfill our contractual obligations. We will inform you of the purposes for which we process cookies as part of our consent and processing processes.</p>
    <p><strong>Storage Duration:</strong> Regarding the storage duration, the following types of cookies are distinguished:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Temporary Cookies (also: Session or Session Cookies):</strong> Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user leaves an online offering and closes their end device (e.g., browser or mobile application).</li>
        <li><strong>Permanent Cookies:</strong> Permanent cookies remain stored even after the end device is closed. For example, login status can be stored or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user revisits a website. The data collected using cookies can also be used for audience measurement. If we do not provide users with explicit information about the type and duration of storage of cookies (e.g., as part of obtaining consent), users should assume that cookies are permanent and can be stored for up to two years.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>General Notes on Revocation and Objection (Opt-Out):</strong> Users can revoke any consent given at any time and also object to processing in accordance with legal requirements under Art. 21 GDPR. Users can also declare their objection through the settings of their browser, e.g., by deactivating the use of cookies (although this may also restrict the functionality of our online services).</p>
    <p><strong>Provision of the Online Offering and Web Hosting</strong></p>
    <p>We process user data to provide them with our online services. For this purpose, we process the user\'s IP address, which is necessary to transmit the contents and functions of our online services to the user\'s browser or device.</p>

    <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Providing online services on rented storage space:&nbsp;</strong>For the provision of our online services, we use storage space, computing capacity, and software that we rent or otherwise obtain from a corresponding server provider (also known as a "web host"); <strong>Legal basis:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR).</li>
        <li><strong>Collection of access data and log files:&nbsp;</strong>Access to our online services is logged in the form of so-called "server log files." Server log files may include the address and name of the accessed web pages and files, date and time of access, transmitted data volumes, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user\'s operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page), and usually IP addresses and the requesting provider. Server log files can be used for security purposes, such as avoiding server overload (especially in the case of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks), and ensuring the servers\' load and stability; <strong>Legal basis:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR); <strong>Data deletion:</strong> Log file information is stored for a maximum of 30 days and then deleted or anonymized. Data whose further storage is necessary for evidentiary purposes is exempt from deletion until the final clarification of the respective incident.</li>
        <li><strong>Email sending and hosting:&nbsp;</strong>The web hosting services we use also include the sending, receiving, and storage of emails. For these purposes, the addresses of recipients and senders, as well as additional information regarding email delivery (e.g., the involved providers) and the contents of the respective emails, are processed. The aforementioned data may also be processed for the purpose of detecting spam. Please note that emails on the internet are generally not sent encrypted. In general, emails are encrypted during transport, but (unless an end-to-end encryption method is used) not on the servers from which they are sent and received. Therefore, we cannot take responsibility for the transmission of emails between the sender and the recipient on our server; <strong>Legal basis:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR).</li>
        <li><strong>Content Delivery Network:&nbsp;</strong>We use a "Content Delivery Network" (CDN).
